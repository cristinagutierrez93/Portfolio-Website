</br>
    <p>Hello! My name is Cristina Gutierrez. I am a wife to my wonderful husband, mother of 2 beautiful children 
        and currently a science teacher. I've always been interested in technology but never considered a career in it. 
        Call it a middle life crisis or a change of course, I decided early this year to shift careers and pursue a web developer bootcamp.</p>
    </br>
    <p>My main focus in completing the web developer bootcamp would be to integrate both my love of teaching and my new interest in tech.</p>
